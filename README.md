Quick Start:
run python main.py
select example_1 when prompted.
open the email_body.html after tool completes.

Currently functionality is extremely limited. Issues have been written to expands its functionality.

The email_generator dynamically generates HTML that will then be converted to an email. 
- NOTE: Currently it doesn't actually generate an email. It generates the html that can be easily converted to an .eml file.
    - I will write the code for this as soon as I can get ahold of a windows machine. (developing on MacOS)


need to install pywin32, yaml
